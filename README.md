# 🧠 Machine Learning Algorithms – From Scratch

This repository is a collection of **core Machine Learning algorithms and implementations** built from scratch using **Python** and popular data science libraries like **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Scikit-learn**.  
Each folder demonstrates a key ML concept — ranging from **supervised and unsupervised learning** to **neural networks**, **recommendation systems**, and **natural language processing (NLP)**.

---

## 📘 Overview
The goal of this repository is to provide **hands-on implementations** of fundamental machine learning algorithms for learning and practice.  
Each project is self-contained, with clean code and step-by-step logic to understand how algorithms work internally.

Would you like me to include a small **“project structure tree”** (showing folders like `APRIORI/`, `KNN/`, `SVM/`, etc.) in the README? It makes the repo visually clear and looks great on GitHub.
