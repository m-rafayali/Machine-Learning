# 🧠 Machine Learning Algorithms – From Scratch

This repository is a collection of **core Machine Learning algorithms and implementations** built from scratch using **Python** and essential libraries like **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Scikit-learn**.

Each folder represents an independent project demonstrating a fundamental **ML concept** — ranging from **supervised and unsupervised learning** to **neural networks**, **recommendation systems**, and **natural language processing (NLP)**.

---

## 📘 Overview

The purpose of this repository is to help learners and practitioners **understand how ML algorithms work internally** by implementing them step by step.
All projects emphasize **clarity, reusability, and experimentation**, providing a strong foundation for further exploration in Machine Learning and Data Science.
